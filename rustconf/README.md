# RustConf 2018 Notes
## Keynote
People Systems Programming
- Unleashing Latent Energy
    - RFC: Scaling Rust Governance
        - Bringing people in who didn't have a formal place in Rust
        - climbed from 20 to 120 people in Rust governance since 2015
        - introduced bots, infrastructure and policy? teams
        - Step 1: Asking for help in release management
            - Impl Period
            - weren't sure this could even be open source
            - started with asking for help and cc'd a lot of people
        - Step 2: Make a Spaceroups
            - What things were blocking others from getting involved.
        - Step 3: Public Recognition. Thanks.
    - Success can be painful
        - Sometimes feels like people are trying to take something from you, or getting in their way.
        - The core team must, but the core team can't
        - Do vs Support
            - Control vs Enjoying the Ride
                - eg. adding `deref` Trait
                    - thought they'd do it himself, but a PR came forward and it was done better than he would've
            - Latency vs Throughput
                - no easy answer, but both sides are possible
    - Itching the same
        - Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch
    - Serendipity
        - If you only run your repos by taking into account those who open
        - Itching everyone the same way so everyine can be involved
- Roadmaps and vision docs

- True Openness
    - Pluralism and Positive Sums
        - Pluralism where 2 or more states can coexist
        - Game Theory
            - Zero sum game - where every participants win is balanced by someone's lost
            - Positive sum game - where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts
    - The Module System Debate
        - crate system debate with multiple RFCs
        - momentum
        - urgency
        - fatigue and scale

- Oppositions
    - Memory safety without garbage collection
    - in formal logic, when we reach a contradiction we are wrong
    - but in a dialictic, we can find that change and progress comes from time and progression in dialictics
    - Thesis -> Antithesis -> synthesis -> Antithesis -> etc
Future of Rust
    - Rust today is not Rust tomorrow
    - conflict doesn't have to generate heat. Can work through them in a positive sum game
    - synthesis means listening and diversity.
