### Why Rust?
Rust initially designed and developed by Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare as a personal project. Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009 and announced it in 2010. But the first stable release, Rust 1.0 released on May 15, 2015.

Rust is very young and very modern language. It‚Äôs a compiled programming language and it uses LLVM on its backend. Also Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language, it supports imperative procedural, concurrent actor, object-oriented and pure functional styles. It also supports generic programming and meta programming, in both static and dynamic styles.

Its design elements came from a wide range of sources.

- Abstract Machine Model : C
- Data types : C, SML, OCaml, Lisp, Limbo
- Optional Bindings : Swift
- Hygienic Macros : Scheme
- Functional Programming : Haskell, OCaml, F#
- Attributes : ECMA-335
- Memory Model and Memory Management : C++, ML Kit,
- Cyclone
- Type Classes : Haskell
- Crate : Assembly in the ECMA-335 CLI model
- Channels and Concurrency : Newsqueak, Alef, Limbo
- Message passing and Thread failure : Erlang

Rust compiler observes the code at compiler time and helps to prevent many types of errors that are possible to write in C++

### Hello World
```
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
- `fn` means function. main function is the beginning of every Rust program.
- `println!` prints text to the console and its ! indicate that it‚Äôs a macro instead of a function.

Execution
- Compile via `rustc file.rs`
- `./file`


### Cargo
- Create a new project: `cargo new`
- Update dependencies: `cargo update`
- Build Project: `cargo run`
- Run tests: `cargo test`
- Generate documentation via rustdoc: `cargo doc`

Other than that there are some cargo commands, especially for publishing creates via cargo.
- Acquire an API token: `cargo login`
- Make the local create uploadable to crates.io: `cargo package`
- Make the local create uploadable to crates.io and upload the crate: `cargo publish`


### Crate
A crate is a package. Crates can be shared via Cargo. A crate can produce an executable o a library. In other words, it can be a binary crate, or a library crate.

eg1. `cargo new crate_name --bin`: produces an executable
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs
```

eg2. `cargo new another_crate_name --lib` OR `cargo new crate_name`: produces a library.
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib.rs
```

- Cargo.toml - config file which contains all of the metadata that Cargo needs to compile a project.
- src - folder for source code.
- Each crate has an implicit crate root/ entry point. `main.rs` is the crate root for a binary crate. `lib.rs` is the crate root for a library crate.

When building a binary crate via `cargo build` or `cargo run`, the executable filel will be stored in `target/debug/` folder. But when building via `cargo build --release` it will be stored in the `target/release/` folder.

### Project Structure

- Source code goes in the `src` directory.
- The default library file is `src/lib.rs`.
- The default executable file is `src/main.rs`.
- Other executables can be placed in `src/bin/*.rs`.
- Integration tests go in the `tests` directory (unit tests go in each file they‚Äôre testing).
- Examples go in the `examples` directory.
- Benchmarks go in the `benches` directory.


### Comments and Documentations
```
// Line Comments
/* Block comments */
```
NOTE: Avoid block comments, and use line comments instead.

#### Doc Comments
```
/// Line comments; document the next item
/** Block comments; document the next item */

//! Line comments; document the enclosing item
/*! Block comments; document the enclosing item !*/
```
Doc comments support  Markdown notations. Using `cargo doc`, the HTML documentation can be generated from these doc comments. Let's see the difference between these two sets of doc comments.

```
/// This module contains tests
mod test {
    // ...
}


mod test {
    //! This module contains tests

    // ...
}
```
NOTE: Only use //! to write crate and module-level documentation, nothing else. When using mod blocks, use /// outside of the block.

### Doc Attributes
We can also doc attributes for documenting the code. An attribute is a general, free-form metadatum that is interpreted acording to name, convention, language, and compiler version. Any declataion may have an attribute applied to it.

Below each comment is equivalent to a relevant data attribute/
```
/// Foo
#[doc="Foo"]

//! Foo
#![doc="Foo"]
```

### Variable bindings, Constants, and Statics
In Rust, variables are immutable by default, so we call them `variable bindings`. To make them mutable, the `mut` keyword is used.

Rust is a statically-typed language. It checks the data type at compile time, but does not require you to type it when declaring variable bindings. In that case, the compuler checks the usage, and sets a better data type for it. But for constants and statics you must annotate the type. Types come after a colon.

- **Variable bindings**
    ```
    let a = true;
    let b: bool = true;

    let (x, y) = (1, 2);

    let mut z = 5;
    z = 6;
    ```
    The `let` keyword is used in binding expressions. We can bind a name to a value || function. Also, because the left-hand side of a `let` expression is a "pattern", you can bind multiple names to set of values or function values.

- **Constants**
    ```
    const N: i32 = 5;
    ```
    The `const` keyword is used to define constants. It lives for the entire lifetime of a program, but has no fixed address in memory.


- **Statics**
    ```
    static N: i32 = 5;
    ```
    `static` is used to define a "global variable" type facility. There is only one instance for each value, and it is at a fixed location in memory. Usually statics are placed on top of the code file, outside functions.


NOTE: Always use `const` instead of `static`. It's pretty rare that you actually want a memory location associated with your constant, and using a `const` allows for optimizations like constant propagation not only in your crate, but also in downstream crates.

### Functions
- Functions are declared with the keyword `fn`
- When using arguments, you must declare data types.
- By default, functions return an empty tuple. If you want to return a value, the type must be specified after ->

#### Passing Arguments
```
fn print_sum(a: i8, b: i8) {
    println!("sum is: {}", a + b);
}
```

#### Returning Values
```
fn plus_one(a: i32) -> i32 {
    a + 1 //no ; means an expression, return a+1
}

fn plus_two(a: i32) -> i32 {
    return a + 2; //return a+2 but bad practice,
    //should use only on conditional returnes, except it's last expression
}

// Function pointers, Usage as a Data Type
let b = plus_one;
let c = b(5); //6

let b: fn(i32) -> i32 = plus_one; //same, with type inference
let c = b(5); //6
```

### Primitive Data Types
Each signed variant can store numbers from `-(2n - 1)` to `2n - 1 - 1` inclusive, where n is the number of bits that variant uses. So an i8 can store numbers from `-(27)` to `27 - 1`, which equals `-128` to `127`. Unsigned variants can store numbers from `0` to `2n - 1`, so a u8 can store numbers from `0` to `28 - 1`, which equals `0` to `255`.

Additionally, the `isize` and `usize` types depend on the kind of computer your program is running on: 64-bits if you‚Äôre on a 64-bit architecture and 32-bits if you‚Äôre on a 32-bit architecture.

You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in Table 3-2. Note that all number literals except the byte literal allow a type suffix, such as `57u8`, and `_` as a visual separator, such as `1_000`.

| Number literals | Example     |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Decimal         | 98_222      |
| Hex             | 0xff        |
| Octal           | 0o77        |
| Binary          | 0b1111_0000 |
| Byte (u8 only)  | b'A'        |

So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you‚Äôre unsure, Rust‚Äôs defaults are generally good choices, and integer types default to `i32`: it‚Äôs generally the fastest, even on 64-bit systems. The primary situation in which you‚Äôd use isize or usize is when indexing some sort of collection.

Rust also has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, which are numbers with decimal points. Rust‚Äôs floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is `f64` because on modern CPUs it‚Äôs roughly the same speed as f32 but is capable of more precision.The `f32` type is a single-precision float, and `f64` has double precision.

- **bool**: true or false
    ```
    let x = true;
    let y: bool = false;
    // no TRUE, FALSE, 1, 0
    ```

- **char**: a single Unicode scalar value
Rust‚Äôs char type represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters, Chinese/Japanese/Korean ideographs, emoji, and zero width spaces are all valid char types in Rust. Unicode Scalar Values range from U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive. However, a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù isn‚Äôt really a concept in Unicode, so your human intuition for what a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù is may not match up with what a char is in Rust. We‚Äôll discuss this topic in detail in the ‚ÄúStrings‚Äù section in Chapter 8.
    ```
    let x = 'x';
    let y = 'üòé';

    // only single quotes
    // because of Unicode support, char is not a single byte, but four.
    ```

- **i8, i16, i32, i64**: Fixed size(bit) signed(+/-) integer types

    | DATA TYPE | MIN                  | MAX                 |
    |-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
    | i8        | -128                 | 127                 |
    | i16       | -32768               | 32767               |
    | i32       | -2147483648          | 2147483647          |
    | i64       | -9223372036854775808 | 9223372036854775807 |

    NOTE: min and max values are based on IEEE standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic. From -2‚Åø‚Åª¬π to 2‚Åø‚Åª¬π-1. You can use `min_value()` and `max_value()` to find the min and max of each integer type. eg. `i9::min_value();`



- **u8, u16, u32, u64**: Fixed size(bit) unsigned(+) integer types

    | DATA TYPE | MIN | MAX                  |
    |-----------|-----|----------------------|
    | u8        | 0   | 255                  |
    | u16       | 0   | 65535                |
    | u32       | 0   | 4294967295           |
    | u64       | 0   | 18446744073709551615 |

    NOTE: Same as signed numbers, min and max values are based on IEEE standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic; From 0 to 2‚Åø-1 . Same way you can use min_value() and max_value() to find min and max of each integer type, ex. u8::max_value();

- **isize**: Variable sized signed(+/-) integer
    Simply this is the data type to cover all signed integer types but memory allocates according to the size of a pointer. Min and max values are similar to i64.

- **usize**: Variable sized unsigned(+) integer
    Simply this is the data type to cover all unsigned integer types but memory allocates according to the size of a pointer. Min and max values are similar to u64.

- **f32**: 32-bit floating point
    Similar to float in other languages, Single precision.
    NOTE: Should avoid using this unless you need to reduce memory consumption badly or if you are doing low-level optimization, when targeted hardware not supports for double-precision or when single-precision is faster than double-precision on it.

- **f64**: 64-bit floating point
    Similar to double in other languages, Double precision

- **arrays** - Fixed size list of elements of same data type

    ```
    let a = [1, 2, 3]; //a[0] = 1
    let mut b = [1, 2, 3];

    let c: [i32; 0] = []; //[Type; # of elements] -> [] /empty array
    let d: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];

    let e = ["my value"; 3]; //["my value", "my value", "my value"];

    println!("{:?}", a); //[1, 2, 3]
    println!("{:#?}", a);
    //  [
    //      1,
    //      2,
    //      3
    //  ]
    ```
    NOTE: Arrays are immutable by defaule. Even with `mut` its element count cannot be changed.

    For a dynamic, growable array, you can use `vec`. Vectors can contain any type of elements, but all elements must be in the same data type.

- **tuples** - Fixed size ordered list of elements of different(or same) data types.
    ```
    let a = (1, 1.5, true, 'a', "Hellow, world!"); // a.0 = 1, a.1 = 1.5, a.2 = true, a.3 = 'a', a.4 = "Hello, world!"

    let b: (i32, f64) = (1, 1.5);

    let (c, d) = b; // c = 1, d = 1.5
    let (e, _, _, _, f) = a; //e = 1, f = "Hello, world!", _ indicates not interested of that item

    let g = (0,); //single-element tuple

    let h = (b, (2, 4), 5); //((1, 1.5), (2, 4), 5)

    println!("{:?}", a); //(1, 1.5, true, 'a', "Hello, world!")
    ```
    NOTE: Tuples are also immutable by default. With `mut` its element count cannot be changed. Also to change an element's value, the new value should have the same data type as the previous value.

- **slice** - Dynamically-sized reference to another data structure
    eg. If you wan tto get or pass part of an array, or any other data structure. Instead of copying it to another array, Rust allows you to create a view/reference to access only that part of the data (mutable or not).
    ```
    let a: [i32; 4] = [1, 2, 3, 4]; //parent array

    let b: &[i32] = &a; //slicing whole array
    let c = &a[0..4]; // from 0th position to 4th(excluding)
    let d = &a[..]; //slicing whole array

    let e = &a[1..3]; //[2, 3]
    let f = &a[1..]; //[2, 3, 4]
    let g = &a[..3]; //[1, 2, 3]
    ```

- **str** - Unsized UTF-8 sequence of Unicode string slices
    ```
    let a = "Hello, world" //aL &'static str
    let b: &str = "„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ, ‰∏ñÁïå!";
    ```
    NOTE: It's an immutable/statically allocated slice holding an unknown sized sequence of UTF-8 code points stored somewhere in memory. `&str` is used to borrow and assign the whole array to the given variable binding.

    A `String` is a heap-allocated string. This string is growable and is also guaranteed to be UTF-8. They are commonly created by converting from a string slice using the to_string() or String::from() methods. eg. `"Hello".to_string();` or `String::from("Hello");`

    In general you should use `String` when you need `ownership`, and `&str` when you just need to borrow a string.

- **functions** - b is a function point to the plus one function.
    ```
    fn plus_one(a: i32) -> i32 {
        a + 1
    }

    let b: fn(i32) -> i32 = plus_one
    let c = b(5); //6
    ```

### Operators
#### Arithmetic Operators
`+ - * / %`

```
let a = 5;
let b = a + 1; //6
let c = a - 1; //4
let d = a * 2; //10
let e = a / 2; // 2 not 2.5
let f = a % 2; //1

let g = 5.0 / 2.0; //2.5

fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```

NOTE: Also `+` is used for array and string concatenation

#### Comparison Operators
`== != < > <= >=`

```
let a = 1;
let b = 2;

let c = a == b; //false
let d = a != b; //true
let e = a < b; //true
let f = a > b; //false
let g = a <= a; //true
let h = a >= a; //true

// üîé
let i = true > false; //true
let j = 'a' > 'A'; //true
```

#### Logical Operators
`! && ||`

```
let a = true;
let b = false;

let c = !a; //false
let d = a && b; //false
let e = a || b; //true
üîé On integer types, ! inverts the individual bits in the two‚Äôs complement representation of the value.


let a = !-2; //1
let b = !-1; //0
let c = !0; //-1
let d = !1; //-2

```
#### Bitwise Operators
`& | ^ << >>`

```
let a = 1;
let b = 2;

let c = a & b; //0  (01 && 10 -> 00)
let d = a | b; //3  (01 || 10 -> 11)
let e = a ^ b; //3  (01 != 10 -> 11)
let f = a << b; //4  (add 2 positions to the end -> '01'+'00' -> 100)
let g = a >> a; //0  (remove 2 positions from the end -> oÃ∂1Ã∂ -> 0)
```

#### Assignment and Compound Assignment Operators
The = operator is used to assign a name to a value or a function. Compound Assignment Operators are created by composing one of `+ - * / % & | ^ << >>` operators with `=` operator

Compound types can group multiple values of other types into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

```
let mut a = 2;

a += 5; //2 + 5 = 7
a -= 2; //7 - 2 = 5
a *= 5; //5 * 5 = 25
a /= 2; //25 / 2 = 12 not 12.5
a %= 5; //12 % 5 = 2

a &= 2; //10 && 10 -> 10 -> 2
a |= 5; //010 || 101 -> 111 -> 7
a ^= 2; //111 != 010 -> 101 -> 5
a <<= 1; //'101'+'0' -> 1010 -> 10
a >>= 2; //101Ã∂0Ã∂ -> 10 -> 2
```

##### Grouping Values into Tuples
A tuple is a general way of grouping together  some number of other values with a variety of types into one compound type.

```
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:
```
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
    let (x, y, z) = tup;
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

In addition to destructuring through pattern matching, we can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (.) followed by the index of the value we want to access. For example:

```
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    let five_hundred = x.0;
    let six_point_four = x.1;
    let one = x.2;
}
```

##### Arrays
Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Arrays in Rust are different than arrays in some other languages because arrays in Rust have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

```
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```

###### Accessing Array Elements
An array is a single chunk of memory allocated on the stack. We can access elements of an array using indexing, like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
```

In this example, the variable named first will get the value 1, because that is the value at index [0] in the array. The variable named second will get the value 2 from index [1] in the array.


#### Type Casting Operator

```
let a = 15;
let b = (a as f64) / 2.0; //7.5
```

Borrowing and Dereference Operators
`& &mut *`

The `&` or `&mut` operators are used for borrowing and * operator for Dereferencing.

NOTE: For more information, refer Ownership, Borrowing & Lifetimes sections.

### Control Flows
**if - else if - else**

```
// Simplest Example
let team_size = 7;
if team_size < 5 {
    println!("Small");
} else if team_size < 10 {
    println!("Medium");
} else {
    println!("Large");
}

// partially refactored code
let team_size = 7;
let team_size_in_text;
if team_size < 5 {
    team_size_in_text = "Small";
} else if team_size < 10 {
    team_size_in_text = "Medium";
} else {
    team_size_in_text = "Large";
}
println!("Current team size : {}", team_size_in_text);

//optimistic code
let team_size = 7;
let team_size_in_text = if team_size < 5 {
    "Small" //no ;
} else if team_size < 10 {
    "Medium"
} else {
    "Large"
};
println!("Current team size : {}", team_size_in_text);


let is_below_eighteen = if team_size < 18 { true } else { false };
```

NOTE: Return data type should be the same on each block, when using this as an expression

##### Using `if` in a `let` statement
Because if is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a let statement, for instance in Listing 3-2:

Filename: src/main.rs
```
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition {
        5
    } else {
        6
    };

    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
```
Listing 3-2: Assigning the result of an if expression to a variable

The number variable will be bound to a value based on the outcome of the if expression. Run this code to see what happens:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30 secs
     Running `target/debug/branches`
The value of number is: 5
```

Remember that blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them, and numbers by themselves are also expressions. In this case, the value of the whole if expression depends on which block of code executes. This means the values that have the potential to be results from each arm of the if must be the same type; in Listing 3-2, the results of both the if arm and the else arm were i32 integers. If the types are mismatched, as in the following example, we‚Äôll get an error:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let condition = true;

    let number = if condition {
        5
    } else {
        "six"
    };

    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
```
When we try to run this code, we‚Äôll get an error. The if and else arms have value types that are incompatible, and Rust indicates exactly where to find the problem in the program:

```
error[E0308]: if and else have incompatible types
 --> src/main.rs:4:18
  |
4 |       let number = if condition {
  |  __________________^
5 | |         5
6 | |     } else {
7 | |         "six"
8 | |     };
  | |_____^ expected integral variable, found reference
  |
  = note: expected type `{integer}`
             found type `&str`
```
The expression in the if block evaluates to an integer, and the expression in the else block evaluates to a string. This won‚Äôt work because variables must have a single type. Rust needs to know at compile time what type the number variable is, definitively, so it can verify at compile time that its type is valid everywhere we use number. Rust wouldn‚Äôt be able to do that if the type of number was only determined at runtime; the compiler would be more complex and would make fewer guarantees about the code if it had to keep track of multiple hypothetical types for any variable.

### Vectors
An array is a fixed-size list of elements, of same data type. Even with `mut`, its element count can not be changed. A `vector` is kind of a re-sizable array but all elements must be in the same type.

It‚Äôs a generic type, written as `Vec<T>` . `T` can have any type, eg. The type of a Vec of i32s is `Vec<i32>`. Also Vectors always allocate their data in dynamically allocated heap.

#### Create empty vector
```
let mut a = Vec::new(); //1.with new() keyword
let mut b = vec![]; //2.using the vec! macro
```

#### Create with data types
```
let mut a2: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
let mut b2: Vec<i32> = vec![];
let mut b3 = vec![1i32, 2, 3];//sufixing 1st value with data type

let mut b4 = vec![1, 2, 3];
let mut b5: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3];
let mut b6  = vec![1i32, 2, 3];
let mut b7 = vec![0; 10]; //ten zeroes
```
#### Access and change data
```
//Accessing and changing existing data
let mut c = vec![5, 4, 3, 2, 1];
c[0] = 1;
c[1] = 2;
//c[6] = 2; can't assign values this way, index out of bounds
println!("{:?}", c); //[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]

//push and pop
let mut d: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
d.push(1); //[1] : Add an element to the end
d.push(2); //[1, 2]
d.pop(); //[1] : : Remove an element from the end


// Capacity and reallocation
let mut e: Vec<i32> = Vec::with_capacity(10);
println!("Length: {}, Capacity : {}", e.len(), e.capacity()); //Length: 0, Capacity : 10

// These are all done without reallocating...
for i in 0..10 {
    e.push(i);
}
// ...but this may make the vector reallocate
e.push(11);
```

#### Mainly a vector represent 3 things,

1. a pointer to the data
2. No of elements currently have(length)
3. capacity (Amount of space allocated for any future elements).

If the length of a vector exceeds its capacity, its capacity will be increased automatically. But its elements will be reallocated(which can be slow). So always use `Vec::with_capacity` whenever it‚Äôs possible.

String data type is a UTF-8 encoded vector. But you can not index into a String because of encoding.

NOTE: Vectors can be used with iterators in three ways,
```
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for i in &v {
    println!("A reference to {}", i);
}

for i in &mut v {
    println!("A mutable reference to {}", i);
}

for i in v {
    println!("Take ownership of the vector and its element {}", i);
}
```
### Structs
Structs are used to encapsulate related properties into one unified datatype. By convention, the name of the struct starts with a capital letter and follows CamelCase.

There are 3 variants of structs
1. C-like structs
    - one or more comma separated name:value pairs
    - brace-enclosed list
    - similar to classes (without its methods) in OOP languages
    - because fields have names, we can access them through dot notation
2. Tuple structs
    - one or more comma separated values
    - parenthesized list like tuples
    - looks like a named tuples
3. Unit structs
    - a struct with no members at all
    - it defines a new type but it resembles an empty tuple, ()
    - rarely in use, useful with generics
NOTE: When regarding OOP in Rust, attributes and methods are placed separately on structs and traits. Structs contain only attributes, traits contain only methods. They are getting connected via impls.

_More complex examples can be found on impls & traits, lifetimes and modules sections._

#### C-like structs
```
// Struct Declaration
struct Color {
    red: u8,
    green: u8,
    blue: u8
}

fn main() {
  // creating an instance
  let black = Color {red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0};

  // accessing its fields using dot notation
  println!("Black = rgb({}, {}, {})", black.red, black.green, black.blue); //Black = rgb(0, 0, 0)

  // structs are immutable by default, use `mut` to make it mutable but doesn't support field level mutability
  let mut link_color = Color {red: 0,green: 0,blue: 255};
  link_color.blue = 238;
  println!("Link Color = rgb({}, {}, {})", link_color.red, link_color.green, link_color.blue); //Link Color = rgb(0, 0, 238)

  // copy elements from another instance
  let blue = Color {blue: 255, .. link_color};
  println!("Blue = rgb({}, {}, {})", blue.red, blue.green, blue.blue); //Blue = rgb(0, 0, 255)

  // destructure the instance using a `let` binding, this will not destruct blue instance
  let Color {red: r, green: g, blue: b} = blue;
  println!("Blue = rgb({}, {}, {})", r, g, b); //Blue = rgb(0, 0, 255)

  // creating an instance via functions & accessing its fields
  let midnightblue = get_midnightblue_color();
  println!("Midnight Blue = rgb({}, {}, {})", midnightblue.red, midnightblue.green, midnightblue.blue); //Midnight Blue = rgb(25, 25, 112)

  // destructure the instance using a `let` binding
  let Color {red: r, green: g, blue: b} = get_midnightblue_color();
  println!("Midnight Blue = rgb({}, {}, {})", r, g, b); //Midnight Blue = rgb(25, 25, 112)
}

fn get_midnightblue_color() -> Color {
    Color {red: 25, green: 25, blue: 112}
}
```

#### Tuple structs
When a tuple struct has only one element, we call it new type pattern. Because it helps to create a new type.

```
struct Color (u8, u8, u8);
struct Kilometers(i32);

fn main() {
  // creating an instance
  let black = Color (0, 0, 0);

  // destructure the instance using a `let` binding, this will not destruct black instance
  let Color (r, g, b) = black;
  println!("Black = rgb({}, {}, {})", r, g, b); //black = rgb(0, 0, 0);

  //newtype pattern
  let distance = Kilometers(20);
  // destructure the instance using a `let` binding
  let Kilometers(distance_in_km) = distance;
  println!("The distance: {} km", distance_in_km); //The distance: 20 km
}
```

#### Unit structs
This is rarely useful on its own, but in combination with other features it can become useful.

eg: A library may ask you to create a structure that implements a certain trait to handle events. If you don‚Äôt have any data you need to store in the structure, you can create a unit-like struct.

```
struct Electron;

fn main() {
  let x = Electron;
}
```

### Enums
An `enum` is a single type. It contains variants, which are possible values of the enum at a given time.

```
enum Day {
    Sunday,
    Monday,
    Tuesday,
    Wednesday,
    Thursday,
    Friday,
    Saturday
}

// Day is the enum
// Sunday, Monday, etc. are the variants
```

Variants can be accessed through `::notation` eg `Day::Sunday`

Each enum variant can have:
    - No data (unit variant)
    - unnamed ordered data (tuple variant)
    - named data (struct variant)

```
enum FlashMessage {
    Success, //a unit variant
    Warning{ category: i32, message: String }, // a struct variant
    Error(String) // a tuple variant
}

fn main() {
    let mut form_status = FlashMessage::Success;
    print_flash_message(form_status);

    form_status = FlashMessage::Warning {category: 2, message: String::from("Field X is required")};
    print_flash_message(form_status);

    form_status = FlashMessage::Warning {category: 2, message: String::from("Field X is required")};
    print_flash_message(form_status);

    form_status = FlashMessage::Error(String::from("Connection Error"));
    print_flash_message(form_status);
}

fn print_flash_message(m: FlashMessage) {
    // pattern matching with enum
    match m {
        FlashMessage::Success =>
            println!("Form Submitted correctly"),
        Flash Message::Warning {category, message} => //Destructure, should use same field names
            println!("Warning : {} - {}", category, message),
        FlashMessage::Error(msg) =>
            println!("Error: {}", msg)
    }
}
```

### Generics
Sometimes, when writing a function or data type, we may want it to work for multiple types. In this case we use `generics`

The concept is, instead of declaring a specific data type, we use an uppercase letter

#### Functions
##### Function Parameters
Functions can also be defined to have parameters, which are special variables that are part of a function‚Äôs signature. When a function has parameters, we can provide it with concrete values for those parameters. Technically, the concrete values are called arguments, but in casual conversation people tend to use the words ‚Äúparameter‚Äù and ‚Äúargument‚Äù interchangeably for either the variables in a function‚Äôs definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a function.

The following rewritten version of another_function shows what parameters look like in Rust:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

When you want a function to have multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with commas, like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    another_function(5, 6);
}

fn another_function(x: i32, y: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

##### Function Statements and Expressions
We‚Äôve actually already used statements and expressions. Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. Expressions evaluate to a resulting value. Let‚Äôs look at some examples.

Creating a variable and assigning a value to it with the let keyword is a statement. In Listing 3-1, let y = 6; is a statement:

Filename: src/main.rs
```
fn main() {
    let x = (let y = 6);
}
```

When you run this program, the error you‚Äôll get looks like this:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
error: expected expression, found statement (`let`)
 --> src/main.rs:2:14
  |
2 |     let x = (let y = 6);
  |              ^^^
  |
  = note: variable declaration using `let` is a statement
```
**The let y = 6 statement does not return a value**, so there isn‚Äôt anything for x to bind to. This is different than in other languages, such as C and Ruby, where the assignment returns the value of the assignment. In those languages, you can write x = y = 6 and have both x and y have the value 6; that is not the case in Rust.

Expressions can be part of statements: in Listing 3-1 that had the statement let y = 6;, 6 is an expression that evaluates to the value 6. Calling a function is an expression. Calling a macro is an expression. The block that we use to create new scopes, {}, is an expression, for example:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

`The value of y is: 4`

This expression:

```
{
    let x = 3;
    x + 1
}
```
is a block that, in this case, evaluates to 4. That value gets bound to y as part of the let statement. Note the x + 1 line without a semicolon at the end, unlike most of the lines you‚Äôve seen so far. Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, which will then not return a value. Keep this in mind as you explore function return values and expressions next.

##### Return Values
Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We don‚Äôt name return values, but we do declare their type after an arrow (`->`). In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in the block of the body of a function. You can return early from a function by using the return keyword and specifying a value, but most functions return the last expression implicitly. Here‚Äôs an example of a function that returns a value:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```
There are no function calls, macros, or even let statements in the five function‚Äîjust the number 5 by itself. That‚Äôs a perfectly valid function in Rust. Note that the function‚Äôs return type is specified, too, as -> i32. Try running this code; the output should look like this:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30 secs
     Running `target/debug/functions`
The value of x is: 5
```
The 5 in five is the function‚Äôs return value, which is why the return type is i32. Let‚Äôs examine this in more detail. There are two important bits: first, the line let x = five(); shows that we‚Äôre using the return value of a function to initialize a variable. Because the function five returns a 5, that line is the same as the following:

`let x = 5;`
Second, the five function has no parameters and defines the type of the return value, but the body of the function is a lonely 5 with no semicolon because it‚Äôs an expression whose value we want to return. Let‚Äôs look at another example:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```
Running this code will print The value of x is: 6. What happens if we place a semicolon at the end of the line containing x + 1, changing it from an expression to a statement? We‚Äôll get an error:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1;
}
```
Running this code produces an error, as follows:

```
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:7:28
  |
7 |   fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
  |  ____________________________^
8 | |     x + 1;
  | |          - help: consider removing this semicolon
9 | | }
  | |_^ expected i32, found ()
  |
  = note: expected type `i32`
             found type `()`
```
The main error message, ‚Äúmismatched types,‚Äù reveals the core issue with this code. The definition of the function plus_one says that it will return an i32, but statements don‚Äôt evaluate to a value, which is expressed by (), the empty tuple. Therefore, nothing is returned, which contradicts the function definition and results in an error. In this output, Rust provides a message to possibly help rectify this issue: it suggests removing the semicolon, which would fix the error.


### Ownership
The rules for ownership are as follows:
    1. Each value in Rust has a variable that‚Äôs called its owner.
    2. There can only be one owner at a time.
    3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

##### Variable Scope
```
{                      // s is not valid here, it‚Äôs not yet declared
    let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

    // do stuff with s
}         
```

##### The String Type
To illustrate the rules of ownership, we need a data type that is more complex than the ones we covered in Chapter 3. The types covered in the ‚ÄúData Types‚Äù section are all stored on the stack and popped off the stack when their scope is over, but we want to look at data that is stored on the heap and explore how Rust knows when to clean up that data.

We‚Äôll use String as the example here and concentrate on the parts of String that relate to ownership. These aspects also apply to other complex data types provided by the standard library and that you create. We‚Äôll discuss String in more depth in Chapter 8.

We‚Äôve already seen string literals, where a string value is hardcoded into our program. String literals are convenient, but they aren‚Äôt always suitable for every situation in which you want to use text. One reason is that they‚Äôre immutable. Another is that not every string value can be known when we write our code: for example, what if we want to take user input and store it? For these situations, Rust has a second string type, String. This type is allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that is unknown to us at compile time. You can create a String from a string literal using the from function, like so:

```

let mut s = String::from("hello");

s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

println!("{}", s); // This will print `hello, world!`
```
##### Memory and Allocation
With the String type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text, we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold the contents. This means:

The memory must be requested from the operating system at runtime.
We need a way of returning this memory to the operating system when we‚Äôre done with our String.

Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope. Here‚Äôs a version of our scope example from Listing 4-1 using a String instead of a string literal:

```
{
    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point forward

    // do stuff with s
}                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no
                                   // longer valid
```

There is a natural point at which we can return the memory our String needs to the operating system: when s goes out of scope. When a variable goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called drop, and it‚Äôs where the author of String can put the code to return the memory. Rust calls drop automatically at the closing }.

To ensure memory safety, there‚Äôs one more detail to what happens in this situation in Rust. Instead of trying to copy the allocated memory, Rust considers s1 to no longer be valid and therefore, Rust doesn‚Äôt need to free anything when s1 goes out of scope. Check out what happens when you try to use s1 after s2 is created, it won‚Äôt work:

```
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;

println!("{}, world!", s1);
```

You‚Äôll get an error like this because Rust prevents you from using the invalidated reference:

```
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `s1`
 --> src/main.rs:5:28
  |
3 |     let s2 = s1;
  |         -- value moved here
4 |
5 |     println!("{}, world!", s1);
  |                            ^^ value used here after move
  |
  = note: move occurs because `s1` has type `std::string::String`, which does
  not implement the `Copy` trait
```

If you‚Äôve heard the terms ‚Äúshallow copy‚Äù and ‚Äúdeep copy‚Äù while working with other languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length, and capacity without copying the data probably sounds like a shallow copy. But because Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of calling this a shallow copy, it‚Äôs known as a move.

##### Ways Variables and Data Interact: Clone
If we do want to deeply copy the heap data of the String, not just the stack data, we can use a common method called clone. We‚Äôll discuss method syntax in Chapter 5, but because methods are a common feature in many programming languages, you‚Äôve probably seen them before.

Here‚Äôs an example of the clone method in action:

```
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();

println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
```

This works just fine and is how you can explicitly produce the behavior shown in Figure 4-3, where the heap data does get copied.

When you see a call to clone, you know that some arbitrary code is being executed and that code may be expensive. It‚Äôs a visual indicator that something different is going on.

##### Stack-Only Data: Copy
There‚Äôs another wrinkle we haven‚Äôt talked about yet. This code using integers, part of which was shown earlier in Listing 4-2, works and is valid:

```
let x = 5;
let y = x;

println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
```

But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don‚Äôt have a call to clone, but x is still valid and wasn‚Äôt moved into y.

The reason is that types like integers that have a known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick to make. That means there‚Äôs no reason we would want to prevent x from being valid after we create the variable y. In other words, there‚Äôs no difference between deep and shallow copying here, so calling clone wouldn‚Äôt do anything differently from the usual shallow copying and we can leave it out.

Rust has a special annotation called the `Copy` trait that we can place on types like integers that are stored on the stack (we‚Äôll talk more about traits in Chapter 10). If a type has the `Copy` trait, an older variable is still usable after assignment. Rust won‚Äôt let us annotate a type with the `Copy` trait if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the Drop trait. If the type needs something special to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the `Copy` annotation to that type, we‚Äôll get a compile time error. To learn about how to add the `Copy` annotation to your type, see Appendix C on Derivable Traits.

So what types are `Copy`? You can check the documentation for the given type to be sure, but as a general rule, any group of simple scalar values can be `Copy`, and nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource is `Copy`.

Here are some of the types that are `Copy`:
- All the integer types, like u32.
- The Boolean type, bool, with values true and false.
- The character type, char.
- All the floating point types, like f64.
- Tuples, but only if they contain types that are also `Copy`. (i32, i32) is `Copy`, but (i32, String) is not.


##### Ownership and Functions
The semantics for passing a value to a function are similar to assigning a value to a variable. Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just like assignment. Listing 4-3 has an example with some annotations showing where variables go into and out of scope:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope.

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here.

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope.

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it‚Äôs okay to still
                                    // use x afterward.

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But since s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope.
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope.
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.

=>
hello
5
```

Listing 4-3: Functions with ownership and scope annotated

If we tried to use s after the call to takes_ownership, Rust would throw a compile time error. These static checks protect us from mistakes. Try adding code to main that uses s and x to see where you can use them and where the ownership rules prevent you from doing so.

##### Return Values and Scope
Returning values can also transfer ownership. Here‚Äôs an example with similar annotations to those in Listing 4-3:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1.

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope.

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3.
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 goes out of scope but was
  // moved, so nothing happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it.

    let some_string = String::from("hello"); // some_string comes into scope.

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function.
}

// takes_and_gives_back will take a String and return one.
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope.

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function.
}
```
The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time: assigning a value to another variable moves it. When a variable that includes data on the heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by drop unless the data has been moved to be owned by another variable.

Taking ownership and then returning ownership with every function is a bit tedious. What if we want to let a function use a value but not take ownership? It‚Äôs quite annoying that anything we pass in also needs to be passed back if we want to use it again, in addition to any data resulting from the body of the function that we might want to return as well.

It‚Äôs possible to return multiple values using a tuple, like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String.

    (s, length)
}
```

But this is too much ceremony and a lot of work for a concept that should be common. Luckily for us, Rust has a feature for this concept, and it‚Äôs called references.

#### References and Borrowing
The issue with the tuple code at the end of the preceding section is that we have to return the String to the calling function so we can still use the String after the call to calculate_length, because the String was moved into calculate_length.

Here is how you would define and use a calculate_length function that has a reference to an object as a parameter instead of taking ownership of the value:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

The length of 'hello' is 5.
First, notice that all the tuple code in the variable declaration and the function return value is gone. Second, note that we pass &s1 into calculate_length, and in its definition, we take &String rather than String.

**Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references. We‚Äôre not allowed to modify something we have a reference to.**

Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the function call here:



let s1 = String::from("hello");

let len = calculate_length(&s1);
The &s1 syntax lets us create a reference that refers to the value of s1 but does not own it. Because it does not own it, the value it points to will not be dropped when the reference goes out of scope.

Likewise, the signature of the function uses & to indicate that the type of the parameter s is a reference. Let‚Äôs add some explanatory annotations:

```
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // s is a reference to a String
    s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what
  // it refers to, nothing happens.
```

The scope in which the variable s is valid is the same as any function parameter‚Äôs scope, but we don‚Äôt drop what the reference points to when it goes out of scope because we don‚Äôt have ownership. Functions that have references as parameters instead of the actual values mean we won‚Äôt need to return the values in order to give back ownership, since we never had ownership.

We call having references as function parameters borrowing. As in real life, if a person owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you‚Äôre done, you have to give it back.

So what happens if we try to modify something we‚Äôre borrowing? Try the code in Listing 4-4. Spoiler alert: it doesn‚Äôt work!

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

Listing 4-4: Attempting to modify a borrowed value

Here‚Äôs the error:

```
error[E0596]: cannot borrow immutable borrowed content `*some_string` as mutable
 --> error.rs:8:5
  |
7 | fn change(some_string: &String) {
  |                        ------- use `&mut String` here to make mutable
8 |     some_string.push_str(", world");
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot borrow as mutable
```

Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references. We‚Äôre not allowed to modify something we have a reference to.

##### Mutable References
We can fix the error in the code from Listing 4-4 with just a small tweak:

Filename: src/main.rs


fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
First, we had to change s to be mut. Then we had to create a mutable reference with &mut s and accept a mutable reference with some_string: &mut String.

But mutable references have one big restriction: you can only have one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope. This code will fail:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s;
```

Here‚Äôs the error:

```
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
 --> borrow_twice.rs:5:19
  |
4 |     let r1 = &mut s;
  |                   - first mutable borrow occurs here
5 |     let r2 = &mut s;
  |                   ^ second mutable borrow occurs here
6 | }
  | - first borrow ends here
```
This restriction allows for mutation but in a very controlled fashion. It‚Äôs something that new Rustaceans struggle with, because most languages let you mutate whenever you‚Äôd like. The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust can prevent data races at compile time.

A data race is similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:

Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
There‚Äôs no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.
Data races cause undefined behavior and can be difficult to diagnose and fix when you‚Äôre trying to track them down at runtime; Rust prevents this problem from happening because it won‚Äôt even compile code with data races!

As always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for multiple mutable references, just not simultaneous ones:

```
let mut s = String::from("hello");

{
    let r1 = &mut s;

} // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

let r2 = &mut s;
A similar rule exists for combining mutable and immutable references. This code results in an error:


let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &s; // no problem
let r2 = &s; // no problem
let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM
```

Here‚Äôs the error:

```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as
immutable
 --> borrow_thrice.rs:6:19
  |
4 |     let r1 = &s; // no problem
  |               - immutable borrow occurs here
5 |     let r2 = &s; // no problem
6 |     let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM
  |                   ^ mutable borrow occurs here
7 | }
  | - immutable borrow ends here
```

Whew! We also cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one. Users of an immutable reference don‚Äôt expect the values to suddenly change out from under them! However, multiple immutable references are okay because no one who is just reading the data has the ability to affect anyone else‚Äôs reading of the data.

Even though these errors may be frustrating at times, remember that it‚Äôs the Rust compiler pointing out a potential bug early (at compile time rather than at runtime) and showing you exactly where the problem is instead of you having to track down why sometimes your data isn‚Äôt what you thought it should be.


##### Dangling References
In languages with pointers, it‚Äôs easy to erroneously create a dangling pointer, a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to someone else, by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory. In Rust, by contrast, the compiler guarantees that references will never be dangling references: if we have a reference to some data, the compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does.

Let‚Äôs try to create a dangling reference, which Rust will prevent with a compile-time error:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    &s
}
```
Here‚Äôs the error:

```
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 --> dangle.rs:5:16
  |
5 | fn dangle() -> &String {
  |                ^ expected lifetime parameter
  |
  = help: this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is
  no value for it to be borrowed from
  = help: consider giving it a 'static lifetime
```
This error message refers to a feature we haven‚Äôt covered yet: lifetimes. We‚Äôll discuss lifetimes in detail in Chapter 10. But, if you disregard the parts about lifetimes, the message does contain the key to why this code is a problem:


this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is no value
for it to be borrowed from.
Let‚Äôs take a closer look at exactly what‚Äôs happening at each stage of our dangle code:

```
fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

    &s // we return a reference to the String, s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
  // Danger!
```

Because s is created inside dangle, when the code of dangle is finished, s will be deallocated. But we tried to return a reference to it. That means this reference would be pointing to an invalid String! That‚Äôs no good. Rust won‚Äôt let us do this.

The solution here is to return the String directly:

```
fn no_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    s
}
```

This works without any problems. Ownership is moved out, and nothing is deallocated.

#### The Rules of References
Let‚Äôs recap what we‚Äôve discussed about references:

1. At any given time, you can have either but not both of:
    - One mutable reference.
    - Any number of immutable references.
2. References must always be valid.
Next, we‚Äôll look at a different kind of reference: slices.

#### Slices
Another data type that does not have ownership is the slice. Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.

Here‚Äôs a small programming problem: write a function that takes a string and returns the first word it finds in that string. If the function doesn‚Äôt find a space in the string, it means the whole string is one word, so the entire string should be returned.

Let‚Äôs think about the signature of this function:

`fn first_word(s: &String) -> ?`

This function, first_word, has a &String as a parameter. We don‚Äôt want ownership, so this is fine. But what should we return? We don‚Äôt really have a way to talk about part of a string. However, we could return the index of the end of the word. Let‚Äôs try that as shown in Listing 4-5:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn first_word(s: &String) -> usize {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return i;
        }
    }

    s.len()
}
```

Listing 4-5: The first_word function that returns a byte index value into the String parameter

Let‚Äôs break down this code a bit. Because we need to go through the String element by element and check whether a value is a space, we‚Äôll convert our String to an array of bytes using the as_bytes method:


`let bytes = s.as_bytes();`
Next, we create an iterator over the array of bytes using the iter method:


`for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {`
We‚Äôll discuss iterators in more detail in Chapter 13. For now, know that iter is a method that returns each element in a collection, and enumerate wraps the result of iter and returns each element as part of a tuple instead. The first element of the returned tuple is the index, and the second element is a reference to the element. This is a bit more convenient than calculating the index ourselves.

Because the enumerate method returns a tuple, we can use patterns to destructure that tuple, just like everywhere else in Rust. So in the for loop, we specify a pattern that has i for the index in the tuple and &item for the single byte in the tuple. Because we get a reference to the element from .iter().enumerate(), we use & in the pattern.

We search for the byte that represents the space by using the byte literal syntax. If we find a space, we return the position. Otherwise, we return the length of the string by using s.len():

```
    if item == b' ' {
        return i;
    }
}
s.len()
```
We now have a way to find out the index of the end of the first word in the string, but there‚Äôs a problem. We‚Äôre returning a usize on its own, but it‚Äôs only a meaningful number in the context of the &String. In other words, because it‚Äôs a separate value from the String, there‚Äôs no guarantee that it will still be valid in the future. Consider the program in Listing 4-6 that uses the first_word function from Listing 4-5:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s); // word will get the value 5.

    s.clear(); // This empties the String, making it equal to "".

    // word still has the value 5 here, but there's no more string that
    // we could meaningfully use the value 5 with. word is now totally invalid!
}
```

Listing 4-6: Storing the result from calling the first_word function then changing the String contents

This program compiles without any errors and also would if we used word after calling s.clear(). word isn‚Äôt connected to the state of s at all, so word still contains the value 5. We could use that value 5 with the variable s to try to extract the first word out, but this would be a bug because the contents of s have changed since we saved 5 in word.

Having to worry about the index in word getting out of sync with the data in s is tedious and error prone! Managing these indices is even more brittle if we write a second_word function. Its signature would have to look like this:


fn second_word(s: &String) -> (usize, usize) {
Now we‚Äôre tracking a start and an ending index, and we have even more values that were calculated from data in a particular state but aren‚Äôt tied to that state at all. We now have three unrelated variables floating around that need to be kept in sync.

Luckily, Rust has a solution to this problem: string slices.

##### String Slices
A string slice is a reference to part of a String, and looks like this:

```
let s = String::from("hello world");

let hello = &s[0..5];
let world = &s[6..11];
```

This is similar to taking a reference to the whole String but with the extra [0..5] bit. Rather than a reference to the entire String, it‚Äôs a reference to a portion of the String. The start..end syntax is a range that begins at start and continues up to, but not including, end.

We can create slices using a range within brackets by specifying [starting_index..ending_index], where starting_index is the first position included in the slice and ending_index is one more than the last position included in the slice. Internally, the slice data structure stores the starting position and the length of the slice, which corresponds to ending_index minus starting_index. So in the case of let world = &s[6..11];, world would be a slice that contains a pointer to the 6th byte of s and a length value of 5.

Figure 4-6 shows this in a diagram.

world containing a pointer to the 6th byte of String s and a length 5

Figure 4-6: String slice referring to part of a String

With Rust‚Äôs .. range syntax, if you want to start at the first index (zero), you can drop the value before the two periods. In other words, these are equal:

```
let s = String::from("hello");

let slice = &s[0..2];
let slice = &s[..2];
```

By the same token, if your slice includes the last byte of the String, you can drop the trailing number. That means these are equal:

```
let s = String::from("hello");

let len = s.len();

let slice = &s[3..len];
let slice = &s[3..];
```
You can also drop both values to take a slice of the entire string. So these are equal:

```
let s = String::from("hello");

let len = s.len();

let slice = &s[0..len];
let slice = &s[..];
```

Note: String slice range indices must occur at valid UTF-8 character boundaries. If you attempt to create a string slice in the middle of a multibyte character, your program will exit with an error. For the purposes of introducing string slices, we are assuming ASCII only in this section; a more thorough discussion of UTF-8 handling is in the ‚ÄúStrings‚Äù section of Chapter 8.

With all this information in mind, let‚Äôs rewrite first_word to return a slice. The type that signifies ‚Äústring slice‚Äù is written as &str:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}
```

We get the index for the end of the word in the same way as we did in Listing 4-5, by looking for the first occurrence of a space. When we find a space, we return a string slice using the start of the string and the index of the space as the starting and ending indices.

Now when we call first_word, we get back a single value that is tied to the underlying data. The value is made up of a reference to the starting point of the slice and the number of elements in the slice.

Returning a slice would also work for a second_word function:

`fn second_word(s: &String) -> &str {`
We now have a straightforward API that‚Äôs much harder to mess up, since the compiler will ensure the references into the String remain valid. Remember the bug in the program in Listing 4-6, when we got the index to the end of the first word but then cleared the string so our index was invalid? That code was logically incorrect but didn‚Äôt show any immediate errors. The problems would show up later if we kept trying to use the first word index with an emptied string. Slices make this bug impossible and let us know we have a problem with our code much sooner. Using the slice version of first_word will throw a compile time error:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s);

    s.clear(); // Error!
}
```
Here‚Äôs the compiler error:

```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --> src/main.rs:6:5
  |
4 |     let word = first_word(&s);
  |                            - immutable borrow occurs here
5 |
6 |     s.clear(); // Error!
  |     ^ mutable borrow occurs here
7 | }
  | - immutable borrow ends here
```
Recall from the borrowing rules that if we have an immutable reference to something, we cannot also take a mutable reference. Because clear needs to truncate the String, it tries to take a mutable reference, which fails. Not only has Rust made our API easier to use, but it has also eliminated an entire class of errors at compile time!

String Literals Are Slices
Recall that we talked about string literals being stored inside the binary. Now that we know about slices, we can properly understand string literals:


`let s = "Hello, world!";`
The type of s here is &str: it‚Äôs a slice pointing to that specific point of the binary. This is also why string literals are immutable; &str is an immutable reference.

##### String Slices as Parameters
Knowing that you can take slices of literals and Strings leads us to one more improvement on first_word, and that‚Äôs its signature:


`fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {`
A more experienced Rustacean would write the following line instead because it allows us to use the same function on both Strings and &strs:


`fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {`
If we have a string slice, we can pass that directly. If we have a String, we can pass a slice of the entire String. Defining a function to take a string slice instead of a reference to a String makes our API more general and useful without losing any functionality:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let my_string = String::from("hello world");

    // first_word works on slices of `String`s
    let word = first_word(&my_string[..]);

    let my_string_literal = "hello world";

    // first_word works on slices of string literals
    let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[..]);

    // since string literals *are* string slices already,
    // this works too, without the slice syntax!
    let word = first_word(my_string_literal);
}
```

##### Other Slices
String slices, as you might imagine, are specific to strings. But there‚Äôs a more general slice type, too. Consider this array:



`let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`
Just like we might want to refer to a part of a string, we might want to refer to part of an array and would do so like this:

`let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`

`let slice = &a[1..3];`
This slice has the type &[i32]. It works the same way as string slices do, by storing a reference to the first element and a length. You‚Äôll use this kind of slice for all sorts of other collections. We‚Äôll discuss these collections in detail when we talk about vectors in Chapter 8.

#### Summary
The concepts of ownership, borrowing, and slices are what ensure memory safety in Rust programs at compile time. The Rust language gives you control over your memory usage like other systems programming languages, but having the owner of data automatically clean up that data when the owner goes out of scope means you don‚Äôt have to write and debug extra code to get this control.

Ownership affects how lots of other parts of Rust work, so we‚Äôll talk about these concepts further throughout the rest of the book. Let‚Äôs move on to the next chapter and look at grouping pieces of data together in a struct.


### Structs
#### Defining and Instantiating Structs
Structs are similar to tuples, which were discussed in Chapter 3. Like tuples, the pieces of a struct can be different types. Unlike tuples, we name each piece of data so it‚Äôs clear what the values mean. As a result of these names, structs are more flexible than tuples: we don‚Äôt have to rely on the order of the data to specify or access the values of an instance.

To define a struct, we enter the keyword struct and name the entire struct. A struct‚Äôs name should describe the significance of the pieces of data being grouped together. Then, inside curly brackets, we define the names and types of the pieces of data, which we call fields. For example, Listing 5-1 shows a struct to store information about a user account:

```
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}
```

Listing 5-1: A User struct definition

To use a struct after we‚Äôve defined it, we create an instance of that struct by specifying concrete values for each of the fields. We create an instance by stating the name of the struct, and then add curly brackets containing key: value pairs where the keys are the names of the fields and the values are the data we want to store in those fields. We don‚Äôt have to specify the fields in the same order in which we declared them in the struct. In other words, the struct definition is like a general template for the type, and instances fill in that template with particular data to create values of the type. For example, we can declare a particular user as shown in Listing 5-2:

```
let user1 = User {
    email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
    username: String::from("someusername123"),
    active: true,
    sign_in_count: 1,
};
```

Listing 5-2: Creating an instance of the User struct

To get a specific value from a struct, we can use dot notation. If we wanted just this user‚Äôs email address, we can use user1.email wherever we want to use this value. If the instance is mutable, we can change a value by using the dot notation and assigning into a particular field. Listing 5-3 shows how to change the value in the email field of a mutable User instance:

```
let mut user1 = User {
    email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
    username: String::from("someusername123"),
    active: true,
    sign_in_count: 1,
};

user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");
```

Listing 5-3: Changing the value in the email field of a User instance

Note that the entire instance must be mutable; Rust doesn‚Äôt allow us to mark only certain fields as mutable. Also note that as with any expression, we can construct a new instance of the struct as the last expression in the function body to implicitly return that new instance.

Listing 5-4 shows a build_user function that returns a User instance with the given email and username. The active field gets the value of true, and the sign_in_count gets a value of 1.

```
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email: email,
        username: username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```

Listing 5-4: A build_user function that takes an email and username and returns a User instance

It makes sense to name the function arguments with the same name as the struct fields, but having to repeat the email and username field names and variables is a bit tedious. If the struct had more fields, repeating each name would get even more annoying. Luckily, there‚Äôs a convenient shorthand!

Using the Field Init Shorthand when Variables and Fields Have the Same Name
Because the parameter names and the struct field names are exactly the same in Listing 5-4, we can use the field init shorthand syntax to rewrite build_user so that it behaves exactly the same but doesn‚Äôt have the repetition of email and username in the way shown in Listing 5-5.

```
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email,
        username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```

Listing 5-5: A build_user function that uses field init shorthand since the email and username parameters have the same name as struct fields

Here, we‚Äôre creating a new instance of the User struct, which has a field named email. We want to set the email field‚Äôs value to the value in the email parameter of the build_user function. Because the email field and the email parameter have the same name, we only need to write email rather than email: email.

Creating Instances From Other Instances With Struct Update Syntax
It‚Äôs often useful to create a new instance of a struct that uses most of an old instance‚Äôs values, but changes some. We do this using struct update syntax.

First, Listing 5-6 shows how we create a new User instance in user2 without the update syntax. We set new values for email and username, but otherwise use the same values from user1 that we created in Listing 5-2:

```
let user2 = User {
    email: String::from("another@example.com"),
    username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
    active: user1.active,
    sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
};
```

Listing 5-6: Creating a new User instance using some of the values from user1

Using struct update syntax, we can achieve the same effect with less code, as shown in Listing 5-7. The syntax .. specifies that the remaining fields not explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.

```
let user2 = User {
    email: String::from("another@example.com"),
    username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
    ..user1
};
```
Listing 5-7: Using struct update syntax to set new email and username values for a User instance but use the rest of the values from the fields of the instance in the user1 variable

The code in Listing 5-7 also creates an instance in user2 that has a different value for email and username but has the same values for the active and sign_in_count fields from user1.

Tuple Structs without Named Fields to Create Different Types
We can also define structs that look similar to tuples (which were discussed in Chapter 3), called tuple structs, that have the added meaning the struct name provides, but don‚Äôt have names associated with their fields; rather, they just have the types of the fields. Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name and make the tuple be a different type than other tuples, but naming each field as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant.

To define a tuple struct you start with the struct keyword and the struct name followed by the types in the tuple. For example, here are definitions and usages of two tuple structs named Color and Point:

```
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
```

Note that the black and origin values are different types, since they‚Äôre instances of different tuple structs. Each struct we define is its own type, even though the fields within the struct have the same types. For example, a function that takes a parameter of type Color cannot take a Point as an argument, even though both types are made up of three i32 values. Otherwise, tuple struct instances behave like tuples: you can destructure them into their individual pieces and you can use a . followed by the index to access an individual value, and so on.

Unit-Like Structs without Any Fields
We can also define structs that don‚Äôt have any fields! These are called unit-like structs since they behave similarly to (), the unit type. Unit-like structs can be useful in situations such as when you need to implement a trait on some type, but you don‚Äôt have any data that you want to store in the type itself. We‚Äôll discuss traits in Chapter 10.

#### Ownership of Struct Data
In the User struct definition in Listing 5-1, we used the owned String type rather than the &str string slice type. This is a deliberate choice because we want instances of this struct to own all of its data and for that data to be valid for as long as the entire struct is valid.

It‚Äôs possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else, but to do so requires the use of lifetimes, a Rust feature that we‚Äôll discuss in Chapter 10. Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct is valid for as long as the struct is. Let‚Äôs say you try to store a reference in a struct without specifying lifetimes, like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
struct User {
    username: &str,
    email: &str,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        email: "someone@example.com",
        username: "someusername123",
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}
```

The compiler will complain that it needs lifetime specifiers:

```
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 -->
  |
2 |     username: &str,
  |               ^ expected lifetime parameter

error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 -->
  |
3 |     email: &str,
  |            ^ expected lifetime parameter
```
In Chapter 10, we‚Äôll discuss how to fix these errors so you can store references in structs, but for now, we‚Äôll fix errors like these using owned types like String instead of references like &str.
